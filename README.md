# ExKMC

This repository implements an explainable clustering algorithm for the minimization of the sum of squared Euclidean distances between data points and its representatives. The results of the Ex-Greedy algorithm are compared to those of the IMM algorithm found in [ExKMC: Expanding Explainable k-Means Clustering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02399.pdf). 

To reproduce the results, please run the full_test_results_02_09.ipynb notebook in the ExKMC folder.
