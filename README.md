# Comparison between IMM and Ex-Greedy algorithms for explainable (decision-tree-induced) clustering 

This repository implements an explainable clustering algorithm for the minimization of the sum of squared Euclidean distances between data points and its representatives. The results of the Ex-Greedy algorithm are compared to those of the IMM algorithm found in [ExKMC: Expanding Explainable k-Means Clustering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02399.pdf). 

To reproduce the results, please run the [notebook in the ExKMC folder](https://github.com/lmurtinho/ExKMC/blob/master/ExKMC/full_test_results.ipynb).
