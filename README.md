# ExKMC

This repository implements an explainable clustering algorithm for the minimization of the sum of squared Euclidean distances between data points and its representatives. The results of the algorithm are compared to those of the IMM algorithm found in [ExKMC: Expanding Explainable k-Means Clustering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02399.pdf).
